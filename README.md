Simulated the starting process of a synchronous motor using MATLAB Simulink with components like field exci
tation, starting resistance, and rotor speed control.â€“ Analyzed motor behavior during startup, observing high initial stator current, torque fluctuations, rotor speed
 build-up, and stabilization of field current.
